## Winget is not recognized

I needed to install a Winget package. But the winget command was not recognized.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\***> winget
winget : The term 'winget' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the
spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

### UPDATE 11am 9/5/2024

lol solved it by adding this path to my user path environment variable

```powershell
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps
```

### Previous Solution 10am 9/5/2024

Run this command to find the install on Windows 11.

```powershell
# source
# https://github.com/yannara/Intune/blob/2c6804acbe1d3abce5d5249f8d10a76ef903a9a4/Winget_apps_v1.17_public.ps1

$winget=Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\' -Filter winget.exe -recurse | Sort-Object -Property 'FullName' -Descending | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty FullName

$winget
```

Add the path to the system environment variable.

Now you can use the winget command.

```powershell
